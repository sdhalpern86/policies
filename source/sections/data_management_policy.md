# Data Management Policy

1healthy.world has procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of electronic protected health information (ePHI) stored in conjunction with 1healthy.world Add-ons and for Customers utilizing our Backup Service once available. This policy, and associated procedures for testing and restoring from backup data, do not apply to Customers that do not elect to add 1healthy.world's Backup Service. The policy and procedures will assure that complete, accurate, retrievable, and tested backups are available for all systems used by 1healthy.world.
  
Data backup is an important part of the day-to-day operations of 1healthy.world. To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI, both for 1healthy.world and 1healthy.world Customers, completes backups are done daily to assure that data remains available when it needed and in case of disaster.

Violation of this policy and its procedures by workforce members may result in corrective disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
